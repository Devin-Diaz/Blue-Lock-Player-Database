## Overview

As a big fan of the **Blue Lock** manga and anime, I have been captivated by the intense and strategic world of soccer portrayed in the series. Blue Lock’s unique approach to character development and its emphasis on the psychological aspects of sports have garnered it a massive following worldwide. The series has inspired many, including myself, to explore the depths of its characters and their evolution throughout the story.

In light of my passion for Blue Lock, I decided to create a **Blue Lock Player Database** — a full-stack web application that captures and displays the detailed attributes of the characters and their progression across different arcs. This project is not only a tribute to the series but also an opportunity to showcase my skills as an aspiring full-stack developer.

## Technologies Used

For this project, I chose popular technologies that are widely used in the industry and offer powerful capabilities for building modern web applications:

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Vercel & Railway

I selected these technologies to enhance my skills and experience as a full-stack developer, while also ensuring that the application is built using reliable and scalable tools.
